# Question
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

Constraints:

* 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup>
* -3 * 10<sup>4</sup> <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup>
* Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

# Solution
## 1. Dict
```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        dt = {}
        for num in nums:
            if num in dt:
                dt[num] += 1
            else:
                dt[num] = 1
        
        for key in dt:
            if dt[key] == 1:
                return key
```

## 2. XOR
```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            nums[0] ^= nums[i]
        
        return nums[0]
```

# Thinking
In XOR solution, the final result only depends on how many times that 1 appears on each bit. Even: 0 and Odd: 1.
